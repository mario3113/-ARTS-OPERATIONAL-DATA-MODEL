# WHAT IS NEW IN THE ARTS ODM VERSION 7.0-7.3?
A retail-specific roadmap for database design that allows a company to plan how it organizes and uses its transaction data.

Starting with verion 7.0, this is the most significant expansion to the ODM in over 10 years. It adds support for retailers to describe and understand customer behavior, to track the consumer-to-customer lifecycle in order to better understand when and why a consumer becomes a customer, and sets the stage for further extension of the ARTS Operational Data Model into promotion management, customer interaction, social networking and other aspects of consumer-retailer interaction.

In addition, the materials provide a sample generated database in SQL Server 2012 populated with sample data for merchandise hierarchies and calendars to help ARTS users understand the model more quickly.

The ARTS ODM offers retailers a comprehensive, mature basis for building integrated applications or selecting off-the-shelf retail solutions, and for helping application developers and analysts understand retail business principles and terminology.
